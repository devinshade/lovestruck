# Lovestruck

  ## Description

  LoveStruck is an online RSVP platform designed to streamline the process of managing wedding guest confirmations. In the era of digital solutions for almost every aspect of life, LoveStruck RSVP stands out as a beacon for couples embarking on the journey of marriage. Our motivation for this project was born from the complexities and often tedious task of tracking who will be joining the couple on their special day. We sought to create a tool that not only saves time but also brings a level of joy and ease to wedding planning.

  Through this application, we solved the all-too-common problem of managing an ever-changing guest list. LoveStruck ensures that all invitations are accounted for, responses are tracked, and no one is accidentally left out. Building this project from the ground up has been a tremendous learning opportunity, allowing us to dive deep into the MERN stack, explore the intricacies of GraphQL, and refine our understanding of responsive web design principles. We emerged from this experience not only with a robust application but with enriched knowledge and new perspectives on full-stack development.
